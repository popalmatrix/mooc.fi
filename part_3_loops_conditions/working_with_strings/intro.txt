After this section

You will be able to use the operators + and * with strings
You will know how to find out the length of a string
You will know what is meant by string indexing
You will know how to look for substrings within a string

String operations
Strings can be combined, or concatenated, with the + operator:

begin = "ex"
end = "ample"
word = begin+end
print(word)
Sample output
example

The * operator can also be used with a string, when the other operand is an integer. The string operand is then repeated the number of times specified by the integer. For example this would work:

word = "banana"
print(word*3)
Sample output
bananabananabanana

Using string operations together with a loop we can write a program which draws a pyramid:

n = 10 # number of layers in the pyramid
row = "*"

while n > 0:
    print(" " * n + row)
    row += "**"
    n -= 1
This prints out the following:

          *
         ***
        *****
       *******
      *********
     ***********
    *************
   ***************
  *****************
 *******************
The print command within the loop prints a line, which begins with n spaces, followed by whatever is stored in the variable row. Then two stars are added to the end of the variable row, and the value of the variable n is decreased by 1.
