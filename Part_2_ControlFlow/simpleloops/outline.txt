Understanding Loops: The core concept is repetition or iteration. A while True loop creates an infinite loop that continues to execute its code block until a specific condition is met to break out of it.

The break Command: This is a crucial command used to exit a loop prematurely. It's the key to stopping a while True loop and preventing an infinite loop. Without a break condition, your program will get stuck in a loop forever.

Input Validation: You can use loops to repeatedly ask for user input until it meets certain criteria, such as a correct PIN or a valid number.

Helper Variables: These are variables that help a loop accomplish its task. They can be used for counting iterations (attempts), accumulating a sum (numbers_sum), or storing previous values (previous_word). They are typically initialized outside the loop and updated inside it.

Debugging: Adding print statements within a loop is an excellent way to debug. You can see the value of your variables at each iteration to understand why the program is behaving unexpectedly. The example with the PIN and the if statement order perfectly illustrates how crucial this is.

String Concatenation: You can use the + operator to combine strings. The example with codes += code + ", " shows how to build a string step-by-step within a loop.

Helper Variables: You learn to use helper variables to keep track of a program's state within a loop. Examples include attempts to count tries, numbers_sum and numbers_count to calculate statistics, and previous_word to check for repetition. This is a fundamental technique for writing more complex programs.

Input Validation: You can use loops to ensure the user provides valid input. The Input validation exercise demonstrates how a loop can repeatedly prompt the user until they enter a number that meets certain criteria (like being a positive number or zero). The provided fix also includes a try-except block to handle non-integer input, which is a good practice for robust programming.
