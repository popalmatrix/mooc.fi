# The line below imports the 'sqrt' function from Python's 'math' module.
# The 'math' module contains many useful mathematical functions.
# Importing 'sqrt' lets us use it directly in our code to find the square root of a number.
from math import sqrt

# The following lines of code prompt the user to enter the values for a, b, and c.
# The input() function gets the user's entry as a string.
# We use float() to convert the string to a floating-point number (a number with a decimal point),
# which is necessary for the mathematical calculations.
a = float(input("The value of a: "))
b = float(input("The value of b: "))
c = float(input("The value of c: "))

# The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula inside the square root, (b² - 4ac).
# We calculate it first and store it in a variable to make the code cleaner and easier to read.
# The double asterisk (**) is the exponentiation operator in Python (b**2 means b to the power of 2).
discriminant = (b**2 - (4*a*c))

# The quadratic formula has two parts due to the '±' (plus/minus) sign.
# Here, we calculate the first root using the plus sign.
root1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a)

# And here, we calculate the second root using the minus sign.
# This gives us the two solutions for the quadratic equation.
root2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a)

# This line uses an f-string to print the final result.
# An f-string (formatted string literal) is a modern way to embed expressions inside string literals.
# It makes it easy to include the values of variables (like root1 and root2) directly within the printed text.
print(f"The roots are {root1} and {root2}")
